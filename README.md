PyBank ~ 

This assignment was quite hard compared to the second half - PyPoll. 

Ultilizng enumerate was a game changer for me.

I went down a few rabbit holes, attempting to add my information to various lists, then iterating through those lists. However, the tutor Geranimo Perez suggested using
enumerate to in order to index the rows in the csv. 

By using "for i,row in enumerate(budget_csv): i was able to use a "if i > 0" statement to iterate through the csv rows starting with the 2nd value. 


This method pulled me out of the lists upon lists rabbit hole I had dug myself into and I am excited to utilize enumerate again. 

Overall, I believe the PyBank section took me around 15 hours to finish. 


PyPoll ~

This one was much easier and straight forward. I was able to knock it out in about an hour.

Not much else to say about this one.
